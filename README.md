# Kubeshark

Kubeshark's source code is fully open and accessible to authenticated and approved users, under the terms of the [BSL 1.1](https://docs.kubeshark.co/en/license) license. While we grant users the liberty to view, use, and modify the source code, much like traditional open-source licenses, we introduce a reasonable limitation on commercial exploitation for a certain period. This allows the project ample opportunity to grow and accrue resources.

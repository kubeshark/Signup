# Kubeshark
Kubeshark's entire source code is open to authenticated and approved users. It can be used under the [BSL 1.1](https://docs.kubeshark.co/en/license) license terms. 
We ask users to be authenticated and be approved prior to gaining access to the code as we'd like to give users the freedom to view, use, and modify the source code, much like traditional open source licenses. All that while introducing a fair limitation on commercial exploitation for a specific period, giving the project a chance to grow and generate resources.

To access our repositories, sign up for a Kubeshark account at https://console.kubeshark.co/ and register your GitHub ID. Once approved, you can find our repositories here:
